			Instrumental Music is composed of three different categories, <a href="Glossary.html">String instruments</a>, <a href="Glossary.html">Brass instruments</a>, and <a href="Glossary.html">Woodwind instruments</a>.

		<h2>String Instruments</h2>

			String instruments make a sound when they are <a href="Glossary.html">plucked</a> by a player's finger or with a <a href="Glossary.html">plectrum</a>, they can also be played using a <a href="Glossary.html">bow</a> that rubs against the strings. The first instance of a string instrument was in Ancient Mesopotamian sites, there was a <a href="Glossary.html">Lyre of Ur</a>. They were played using the fingertips of the people, and it created a delicate and warm sound that filled the room. String instruments do not require wind to produce sound, and for that reason, it isn't a <a href="Glossary.html">wind instrument</a>.

		<h2>Wind Instruments (Brass)</h2>

		<p>
			<a href="Glossary.html">Brass instruments</a> are instruments which are made from brass. They are always played using a mouthpiece which is made out of silver plating as it is inexpensive and makes it easier for the player to produce a good sound. Brass instruments require a player to <a href="Glossary.html">buzz</a> and wind which makes it apart of the wind instruments. The mouthpiece should be in the middle of the player's lips. Brass instruments usually create a harsh sound.

		<h2>Wind Instruments (Woodwinds)</h2>
		<img id="Woodwind" src="Woodwind.jpg" alt="An image with several woodwind instruments" width="400" height="250">
		<img id="WoodwindMP" src="Woodwind_Mouthpiece.jpg" alt="An image of a woodwind mouthpiece" width="400" height="250">
		<p>
			<a href="Glossary.html">Woodwind instruments</a> are instruments that have a reed (wood) and use wind to be played hence the name woodwind. Woodwind mouthpieces are not as durable as brass instruments as the mouthpiece is made out of plastic which isn't durable, this applies to all woodwind instruments except for the flute. However, wind instruments make a more delicate sound as opposed to brass instruments.
