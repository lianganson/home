			Instrumental Music is composed of three different categories, String instruments, Brass instruments, and Woodwind instruments.

		<h2>String Instruments</h2>

			String instruments make sound when they are plucked by a player's finger or with a plectrum, they can also be played using a bow that rubs against the strings. The first instances of a string instrument was in Ancient Mesopotamian sites, there was a Lyre of Ur. They were played using the fingertips of the people, and it created a delicate and warm sound that filled the room. Later in the medieval era,  Middle Eastern rebecs represented breakthroughs in terms of shape and strings, with a half a pear shape using three strings. As we continue through time we pass the Baroque Era (1600-1750)

			Brass instruments are instruments which are made from brass. They are always played using a mouthpiece which is made out of silver plating as it is inexpensive, and make it easier for the player to produce a good sound. Brass instruments require a player to "buzz" (it is the action of blowing while your upper lip is over your bottom lip) The mouthpiece should be in the middle of the players lips. Brass instruments usually create a harsh sound.

		<h2>Wind Instruments (Woodwinds)</h2>

		<p>
			Woodwind instruments are instruments that have a reed (wood) and use wind to be played hence the name woodwind. Woodwind mouthpieces are not as durable as brass instruments as the mouthpiece is made out of plastic which isn't durable, this applies to all woodwind instruments except for the flute. However wind instruments make a more delicate sound as opposed to brass instruments.
